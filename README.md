# Battleship

A text-based game of battleship I made
----------------------------------------
The program asks the user what level of difficulty
the user wants to choose for the game (e.g easy, medium, or hard.)
The size of the board, as well as the number of ships placed 
on the board increases respective to the difficulty level the user chooses. 
The number of lives however, decreases with the level of difficulty. 
This program was made early on in my experience with Java, yet it allowed me to creatively 
think about how different classes can work off of one another.
